Welcome to FINA 6333 for Spring 2025 at the D'Amore-McKim School of Business at Northeastern University!

For each course topic, we will have one notebook for the pre-recorded lecture and one for the in-class practice exercises.
I will maintain these notebooks on this website because Canvas does not render notebooks.
I will maintain everything else on Canvas (e.g., announcements, grades, etc.).

You have three choices to download or run these notebooks:

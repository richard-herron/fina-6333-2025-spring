Welcome to FINA 6333 for Spring 2025 at the D'Amore-McKim School of Business at Northeastern University!

For each course topic, we will have one notebook for the pre-recorded lecture and one for the in-class practice.
I will maintain these notebooks on here and everything else on Canvas.
You have three choices to access these notebooks:

1. Download them from [OneDrive](https://northeastern-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/r_herron_northeastern_edu/ElSKCp7KsodKq21d2ydTIL8BIaha56J0VxUm7CxObo-wVA?e=1s8bB8)
